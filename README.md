Hiss and Nibble

Leah Henry & Robin Henry

Hiss and Nibble is a 2D game made with Turtle and Python. It is based off of the vintage snake games that were very popular. During the game, you are a snake and your duty is to consume the randomly
generated food. Upon eating, the snake gets larger, scores more points, and levels up. Higher levels indicate higher difficulty. If the snake does not consume anything,
segments of its tail will be removed as it is "starving" and it will be game over.
Highscores are kept track of throughout the game.
